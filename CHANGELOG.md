## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Permanent trust per session. The "Allow ▾" popover, the sidebar hover
  clock popover, the session-row right-click menu, and the menu-bar
  approval card all expose a "Trust forever" option that auto-approves
  every subsequent tool call from that session until the user cancels
  or the app quits. The session row badge renders ∞ in amber when
  permanently trusted (vs. the mint countdown for time-boxed windows).
- Per-turn completion notifications. When Claude finishes responding in
  a session (Stop hook), cc-dashboard now posts a banner with the user's
  prompt as the body — folded to ~140 chars for long prompts. The
  previous "session ended" banner has been removed (it fired only when
  the whole CLI exited, which is the noisier and less useful signal).
  A new `UserPromptSubmit` hook is registered automatically; existing
  installs upgrade their `~/.claude/settings.json` on next launch.
- Trust persistence. Both "Trust forever" and time-boxed grants now
  survive app quit / restart — keyed by project directory (cwd), since
  session IDs are ephemeral. When a new Claude session starts in a
  trusted cwd, the trust auto-applies; expired time-boxed entries are
  garbage-collected on launch. Cancelling trust ("×" on the badge,
  right-click menu, or DELETE /trust) clears the persisted entry.

### Changed
- Turn-complete notification is now debounced by 2 seconds. Claude Code's
  `Stop` hook can fire mid-turn under some conditions (agentic
  continuation, extended-thinking checkpoints — the public docs don't
  guarantee a single fire per turn). The banner now posts only after
  the session has been quiet for 2 s; any incoming `PreToolUse` or new
  `UserPromptSubmit` cancels the pending banner. UI status (`.idle`)
  still updates immediately for responsiveness.
- Approval card layout: "Trust forever" is now a top-level button next
  to "Allow" (instead of being one of several entries inside the
  "Allow ▾" popover). The two confirm-style actions sit on the left,
  "Deny" is pushed to the far right so a misclick is harder. The ▾
  attached to "Trust forever" still opens the time-boxed presets
  (2 / 10 / 30 min, custom). Same layout for the menu-bar approval card
  and the main-window queue.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-04-24

### Added
- Custom trust duration. Both the approval card "Allow ▾" popover and the
  sidebar hover clock popover now include an inline minutes field next to
  the 2 / 10 / 30 presets — type any value up to 24 h and press Return.
  The session-row right-click menu and the menu-bar approval card get a
  "Custom duration…" item that opens a small dialog for the same purpose.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-23

### Changed
- Starting a trust window now also approves any already-pending approvals
  for that session, matching the user intent that "I trust this session"
  should cover the request currently waiting, not just future ones.

### Fixed
- Row-level trust popover no longer vanishes when the cursor moves from
  the hover-revealed clock button onto the popover options. The button
  now stays mounted while the popover is open.
- Enlarged the chevron hit area next to the "Allow" button in both the
  approval card (`46×32pt`, was `~28×24pt`) and the menu-bar popover
  (`36×28pt`, was `~22×18pt`). Full padding region is now tap-active via
  `contentShape`.
- `TrustPickerMenu` trust-duration rows (2 / 10 / 30 min) now accept
  clicks across the full row width. Previously only the icon + text +
  `⌘N` shortcut hint were hit-active; the middle `Spacer` region and
  transparent padding swallowed clicks on the "2 min" and "30 min" rows
  (the 10 min row worked because its highlighted background was a
  non-transparent hit surface).

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- Rename sessions inline (double-click the name) or via the row context menu.
  Aliases are keyed by cwd and persisted in `UserDefaults` under
  `sessionAliases`, so reopening a project auto-restores the name. When no
  alias is set the row falls back to the first 8 characters of the session id.
- Row-level auto-trust: hover a session to reveal a clock icon that opens a
  2 / 10 / 30-minute trust picker, or use the context menu — no waiting for
  the next approval to set a window.
- Firebase Analytics + Crashlytics integration (anonymous events only — never
  command content, file paths, or cwd). Opt out via `defaults write
  com.heypanda.cc-dashboard analyticsEnabled 0`.
- Localization: English (source) and Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`).
- Test suite (`Tests/CCDashboardTests/`): `SessionStore` with injected `now` /
  `delay` seams, `HooksInstaller` settings merge, Codable contract round-trips,
  HTTP/WebSocket integration via `HummingbirdTesting`.
- GitHub Actions CI (`test.yml`) — `swift test` on every push/PR.
- GitHub Actions release workflow (`release.yml`) — build, sign, notarize,
  staple, upload DMG, update appcast + Homebrew Cask tap atomically.
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`,
  issue/PR templates.

### Changed
- App display name is now "CC Dashboard" (`CFBundleDisplayName` +
  `CFBundleName`). Bundle identifier stays `com.heypanda.cc-dashboard` for
  binary compatibility with existing installs.
- Release runner upgraded to `macos-15` for Swift 6.0 tools; language mode
  pinned to Swift 5 for CI reproducibility.

### Fixed
- `SessionStore`: replaced `Task.sleep(for:)` with an injected `delay`
  closure to avoid the `swift_task_dealloc` abort reported under concurrent
  load (see commit `fffadbc`).
- `MenuBarIconRenderer` isolated to `@MainActor` for Swift 6 strict
  concurrency compliance.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

Initial public release.

### Added
- Native macOS menu-bar app that centralizes `PreToolUse` approvals across
  concurrent Claude Code sessions.
- Three-state menu-bar icon (idle / pending / auto-allow) with template image
  that auto-inverts for light/dark.
- Pinnable popover (hand-rolled `NSStatusItem` + `NSPanel`).
- Main window: session sidebar + approval queue with collapsible tool inputs
  and risk-edge coloring (red for destructive, amber for write-capable).
- Temporary trust windows per session (2 / 10 / 30 minutes) and "Allow all"
  (⌘↩) batch action.
- Embedded Hummingbird HTTP + WebSocket server on `127.0.0.1:7788`.
- Native `UserNotifications` for incoming approvals and finished sessions.
- `install-hooks.sh` CLI installer and app-side auto-installer; `settings.json`
  is backed up before modification.
- Sparkle auto-update with EdDSA-signed appcast.
- Homebrew Cask distribution via `heypandax/cc-dashboard` tap.
